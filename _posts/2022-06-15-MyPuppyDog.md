She kneels her neck<br />
like black swans under night.<br />
The daffodils flip.<br />

Midnight sleep<br />
with the moon in face.<br />
Midnight sleep<br />
with vivid dreams, terrors<br />
beyond what the world handles<br />
from day to day, church to school.<br />
Midnight sleep.

It haves you<br />
with rough throats and necks<br />
wanting peace.

And yet what some<br />
get in KPop is angry fans<br />
and redone dresses.

My Yeohyoon<br />
you were to good for KPop.<br />
My Yeohyoon.<br />
I prefer JPop, and yet I feel<br />
like a Serf to your hair.<br />
With Dami the maid of honor.<br />
My Yeohyoon.

And yet your in South Korea,<br />
And Iâ€™m in the US wanting to go Ashibahara.<br />
And draw manga in Kumamoto.
