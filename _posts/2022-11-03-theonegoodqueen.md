Potato bash.<br />
Crush it into a fine pulp.<br />
Potato bash,<br />
let the butteryness rain.<br />
And all the salt from its meat.<br />
Let the farmers own their work.<br />
Potato bash.

Put the Kings head<br />
on a spike, killed by dikes.<br />
Place the familys head on a spike.

Potato bash.<br />
Crush it into a fine pulp.<br />
Potato bash,<br />
let the butteryness rain.<br />
And all the salt from its meat.<br />
Let the farmers own their work.v
Potato bash.

Lets tap dance to blood,<br />
From the necks of tyrants,<br />
That deprive us of all the food.
