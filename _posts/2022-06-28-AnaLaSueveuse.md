Girl in white<br />
with her French braids and flowers.<br />
   In her hair.<br />
Girl in white<br />
The midnight chilly weather chills<br />
you and me, near the fire<br />
place tonight. The starlight.<br />
Girl in white.

Oh girl in white, with the braid<br />
The soldiers came and took her away from me.<br />
My bride and wife to be. My doll.<br />
My necrophilic braid.

Don't worry about me,<br />
go and save the Koreans.<br />

To that at only<br />
sixteen, she went away and<br />
and with a rifle<br />
And save the world from greed.

And returned with only<br />
A facial bleed.
