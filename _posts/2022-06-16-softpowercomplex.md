For soft power,<br />
its not who controls the planet.<br />
For soft power,<br />
like other measurements<br />
of strength, the winner matters not<br />
but who is on in total control.<br />
For soft power

breeds a revolt<br />
that escelates quickly...<br />
Winter soon chills.

For soft power,<br />
its not who controls the planet.<br />
For soft power,<br />
like other measurements<br />
of strength, the winner matters not<br />
but who is on in total control.<br />
For soft power

Even if US Koreas,<br />
with KPop domination,<br />
it leaves those who truly desire freedom<br />
feeling vacant.

Because this desire doesnt stem,<br />
from battles on the Pacific Rim.<br />
But rather along the coast of capitalism.<br />
With the manga flag supreme.

Thats why songs of revolution,<br />
cannot blend with two face sports teams,<br />
based on competitive singing.
